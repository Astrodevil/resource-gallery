Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data. Hacking is not always a malicious activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.

## How does hacking work?
So, how do hackers hack? Hackers use a variety of techniques to achieve their aims. Some of the most common methods include:

## Social engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique designed to exploit human error to gain access to personal information. Using a fake identity and various psychological tricks, hackers can deceive you into disclosing personal or financial information. They may rely on phishing scams, spam emails or instant messages, or even fake websites to achieve this.

## Hacking passwords

Hackers use different ways to obtain passwords. The trial and error method is known as a brute force attack, which involves hackers trying to guess every possible combination to gain access. Hackers may also use simple algorithms to generate different combinations for letters, numbers, and symbols to help them identify password combinations. Another technique is known as a dictionary attack, which is a program that inserts common words into password fields to see if one works.

## Infecting devices with malware

Hackers may infiltrate a user’s device to install malware. More likely, they will target potential victims via email, instant messages and websites with downloadable content or peer-to-peer networks.

Exploiting insecure wireless networks

Rather than using malicious code to infiltrate someone’s computer, hackers may simply take advantage of open wireless networks. Not everyone secures their router, and this can be exploited by hackers driving around looking for open, unsecured wireless connection. This is an activity known as wardriving. Once hackers are connected to the unsecured network, they only need to bypass basic security to gain access to devices connected to that network.

## Gaining backdoor access

Hackers may create programs that search for unprotected pathways into network systems and computers. Hackers may gain backdoor access by infecting a computer or system with a Trojan horse, created by hackers to acquire and steal important data without the victim noticing.

## Spying on emails

Hackers can create code which allows them to intercept and read emails. Most email programs today use encryption formulas which mean that even if hackers intercept a message, they can't read it.

## Logging keystrokes

Some programs allow hackers to track every keystroke a computer user makes. Once installed on a victim's computer, the programs record each keystroke, giving the hacker everything they need to infiltrate a system or steal someone’s identity.

## Creating zombie computers

A zombie computer, or bot, is a computer that a hacker can use to send spam or commit Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. After a victim executes a seemingly innocent code, a connection opens between their computer and the hacker's system. The hacker can then secretly control the victim’s computer, using it to commit crimes or spread spam.

## What harm might hackers cause?
1. Cybersecurity hacking can have devastating effects. Regardless of the method hackers employ, once they have accessed your data or devices, they can:

2. Open credit card and bank accounts in your name, then steal your money.
ruin your credit score
3. ask for a new account PINs for personal identification or supplementary credit cards
4. Purchase things on your behalf
5. Add yourself or a controlled alias as an authorized user to make it simpler to utilize your credit Obtain payday loans
6. Utilize and misappropriate your Social Security number
7. Sell your information to third parties who will use it nefariously.
8. On your computer, delete or corrupt crucial files.
9. Obtain sensitive personal information, release it publicly, or threaten to do so

## Hacking prevention
You can protect yourself against hackers by following good cybersecurity hygiene. Here are some key hacking prevention tips to bear in mind:

Use strong passwords

A big part of hacking is getting hold of users' passwords. It is therefore essential to use a strong and unique password for each online account. A strong password is made up of at least 12 characters – ideally more – and is a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters. It can be difficult keeping track of multiple passwords, so using a password manager can help.

1. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Turn on two-factor or multi-factor authentication for as many of your online accounts as possible. MFA uses a second piece of information – often a code generated by an app or sent via SMS – alongside a password, adding another layer of security to your accounts.

2. Be vigilant against phishing

Successful hacking often starts with phishing emails or texts. Be alert: when a new email or text message arrives, and it includes a link or attachment, our initial instinct can often be to click or tap on it. Avoid this temptation – don’t open messages from unknown senders, never click on a link or open an attachment in an email you’re not sure about and delete messages you suspect to be spam.
