**About**

AWS Marketplace is an online store provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables customers to find, purchase, and deploy a wide variety of software products and services. It is a platform where third-party software vendors can list and sell their products to AWS customers.

You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer (subscriber) a seller (provider), or both. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a consumer and can register to become a seller. A seller can be an independent software vendor (ISV), value-added reseller, or individual with something that works with AWS products and services.

**Introduction**

You can quickly launch pre-configured software with just a few clicks, and choose software solutions in Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and software as a service (SaaS) formats and other formats. Additionally, you can browse and subscribe to data products. Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi-year, and a Bring Your License (BYOL) model. All of these pricing options are billed from one source. AWS handles billing and payments, and charges appear on your AWS bill.
