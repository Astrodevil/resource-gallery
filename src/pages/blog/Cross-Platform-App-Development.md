## What is cross-platform app development?
With mobile apps now becoming a critical part of businesses, it’s important that you understand the intricacies of developing an app. Cross-platform mobile development is the development of software applications that work with several mobile operating systems.

Regarding cross-platform apps, developers can share some or even all of the source code. This means that developers can build and deploy mobile assets that work on Android and iOS without recording them for each platform.

## Native Vs Cross-Platform Development

So what is native mobile app development? The term native mobile app development refers to building a mobile app exclusively for a single platform. The app is built with programming languages and tools that are specific to a single native platform – iOS or Android.

## What is a native platform?

Well, there are two main mobile OS platforms – Apple's iOS and Google's Android. For example, you can use Java or Kotlin for native application development in Android and choose Swift and Objective-C for iOS apps. That, respectively, gives an answer to the question “what's a native app?”

## What Is Cross-Platform App Development?
So what’s cross-platform development? Cross-platform mobile app development is the process of creating an app that works on several platforms. This is done by using tools like React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter, where the apps created can be deployed on both Android and iOS.

While cross-platform app development saves time and cost, you risk sacrificing quality in the process. It is difficult to tailor an app that runs optimally on various platforms, and the app will need an additional abstraction layer when running, thus resulting in lower performance.

Startups will favor the reduction in time and cost with cross-platform development. However, you’ll need to bear in mind that it might be more difficult to customize the app beyond what’s allowed in the framework.

Healthcare data access: Blockchain could be used to store and share healthcare data in a secure and decentralized way. This could give patients more control over their data and make it easier for doctors to access the information they need.

These are just a few of the many potential future applications of blockchain technology. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbreaking applications emerge.

## Pros Of Cross-Platform Mobile App Development
Let’s now look at the main benefits of cross platform mobile app development as compared to native mobile app development.

## Less Costly  
Instead of having two teams of developers, you’ll need only one to create a cross-platform mobile app. Therefore, you’ll save on the

## Faster Development
Only a single cycle of cross-platform development is needed to create an app that runs on multiple platforms.

## Single Code Base
As the app is created with a single cross-platform development tool, only one code base is created.
