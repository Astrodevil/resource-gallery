### 🧑🏼‍💻 When Computer Networks Were About Nationalism

ARPANET, Minitel, Mark I and the race to invent the internet

Some fun news first: I’ve signed a contract with No Starch Press to write my first technical book. The project can be roughly described as The Art of War for legacy modernization: when to do it, how to organize it, common problems and various tricks I’ve picked up to get stuff done. I got a wonderful opportunity this month to test out the content of early chapters on a live audience of software engineers when Øredev invited me to give a keynote in Malmö, Sweden. They asked me if I could do a talk on the intersection of technology and sociology and I was like “Oh boy… CAN I!”

### 🧑🏼‍💻 What computer networks are and how to actually understand them?

Whether you are new to the world of development, or have been building things for a long time — or even if you’re a person who just likes computers and uses the internet daily — you’ve got to know the basics of networking and specifically Computer Networks.

If you like digging more into servers, their security, and how you connect to your servers from a remote client, all of this requires some knowledge of computer networks and their components. I have tried to cover most of the topics concerning computer networks in this article.

Also, from here, I will refer to “computer networks” simply as “networks”.

### 🧑🏼‍💻 The Woman Who Made Computer Networks More Resilient

In the coming weeks leading up to this year’s International Women’s Day, I’d like to talk about some of the inspirational women who’ve greatly influenced technology and whose groundbreaking inventions and contributions have shaped the world in which we live.

This week’s iconic woman in Tech is Radia Perlman, the inventor of STP — the spanning tree protocol.
